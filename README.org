* Everything that you never wanted to know about building containers in OBS

This repository contains the slides for the presentation "Everything that you never wanted to know about building containers in OBS" held at the openSUSE Conference 2023.

You can find the rendered slides here: [[https://dcermak.github.io/building-containers-in-obs/building-containers-in-obs.html][dcermak.github.io/building-containers-in-obs]].


** Building the slides

You can create the html slides yourself from within Emacs by opening the
[[./building-containers-in-obs.org]] file, launching =org-mode= and executing ~(require
'ox-reveal)~ (you might have to install =ox-reveal= beforehand). Then export the
org file to reveal.js (this is by default bound to the keychord =C-c C-e R R=).

If you are not a Emacs user, then just install Emacs and execute:
#+begin_src bash
emacs building-containers-in-obs.org -Q --batch -l export-init.el -f org-reveal-export-to-html --kill
#+end_src
